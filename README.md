# E-commerce
I successfully designed and developed a fully functional webshop or e-commerce store using a modern tech stack, including Angular/TypeScript, Express.js, and Stripe. The main objectives of this project were to learn how to implement Angular Material and Tailwind to create an intuitive user interface and seamlessly integrate external APIs.
